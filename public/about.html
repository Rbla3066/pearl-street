With a skilled and experienced staff whose only focus is LED lighting and control systems, <strong>Pearl Street</strong> designs and installs custom engineered solutions that deliver measurable long-term value.
        </p>
        <p>
        LED lighting almost sounds too good to be true because it seems to "do it all" by reducing energy costs, virtually eliminating lighting maintenance and improving the quality of lighting. So what are the potential risks with a new LED lighting system? These risks can include the following:
      </p>
      
        <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        <br>
        <ul class="list-group" style="margin: auto; width: 80%">
          <li><h4>You overpaid for the system</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Forecasted energy savings are not achieved</h4></li>
          <li><h4>The system and equipment is not reliable and maintenance free as promised</h4></li>
          <li><h4>The lighting quality is poor (low or uneven light levels, glare, etc.)</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Light levels decrease and color temperature change unexpectedly over time</h4></li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="dividerLine"></div>
        <br>
      <p>
        An LED lighting system should last 15-20 years or more, and if the project is unsuccessful, you are going to live with the poor results and the recurring complaints from the building occupants for a very long time, and it will be difficult to economically justify a future lighting upgrade (because there just isn’t much more energy left to save).
      </p>
      <p>
        So what can you do to ensure a successful lighting project and mitigate these risks? The answer is:  don’t take shortcuts and fall victim to overly simplistic and vendor biased/influenced solutions commonly offered in the marketplace. Partner with a <strong>SPECIALIZED</strong>, <strong>EXPERIENCED</strong>, <strong>INDEPENDENT</strong>, <strong>UNBIASED</strong> and <strong>PROFESSIONAL</strong> LED lighting systems integrator and professional services provider. And that firm is <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong> is one of the largest LED lighting system integrators and professional service providers in the Northeast. We have an impressive list of satisfied customers who have one thing in common: they demand high quality, professionalism and measurable value.

       Pearl Street’s services cover every phase of LED lighting systems implementation including: initial planning, comprehensive investment grade lighting audits, professional lighting design and engineering services, equipment procurement and supply, project management, design-supply or turnkey design-build project delivery and project financing.
      </p>
      <p><b>Pearl Street Systems differentiates itself from other LED equipment and upgrade providers in these key areas:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4 class="listHeader">THOUGHTFUL LIGHTING ANALYSIS, DESIGN AND ENGINEERING</h4>
          <p>With lighting efficiency upgrades and renovations, Pearl Street does not take shortcuts with “one for one wattage equivalent” fixture replacements that, in the end, will typically result in larger (and more expensive) and greater quantities of LED fixtures than what is needed. Lighting analysis and design more than pays for itself in lower capital and lifetime operating costs. But many lighting retrofit companies, ESCO’s, electrical contractors and even architectural firms do not have in-house staff, design/analysis software and processes to develop, design and install LED lighting systems. They commonly say that design is not necessary and prohibitively expensive – but the fact is that they don’t have these capabilities nor the LED equipment and controls expertise.<br><br>Pearl Street is well versed the energy aspect of lighting: life-cycle costs, energy codes/standard compliance and maximizing utility incentives and energy tax credits. <br><br>We are also very knowledgeable of lighting equipment pricing  Lighting equipment pricing for new construction projects is typically NOT transparent.  End-customers can unknowingly pay double for an LED fixture as compared to the same fixture in another region of the country.   We guide customers through this pricing  “maze”, saving considerable money.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="listHeader">A SOLE FOCUS ON LED LIGHTING SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS</h4>
          <p>Unlike an ESCO (Energy Service Company), engineering firms, electrical distributers and electrical contractor LED lighting and controls is the only thing l we do.  And most architects and lighting design firms lack the controls experience and “sub: this work out to the manufacturers or other “biased” vendors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="listHeader">MANUFACTURER INDEPENDENT</h4>
          <p>There isn’t a single lighting equipment manufacturer in the marketplace that can effectively cover all lighting applications. Each have strengths and weaknesses in performance and price, and with new products continuously entering the market this is always changing.  Understandably, lighting equipment manufacturers and their sales agencies and electrical distributers push their lines over the customer’s needs.  And incredibly, some architects have royalty agreements with lighting manufacturers for specifying their products, as well as allow the manufacturers to perform their lighting designs (for free of course but with the understanding that their equipment can’t be substituted).  These conflicts of interest are very common and put their interest above the end-customer’s resulting in much higher capital costs and lower long term system performance.<br><br>At Pearl Street, we are not in the business of representing the interests of specific lighting manufacturers like a lighting representative/agent or electrical distributer does.   <b>We are in the business to serve our customers best interests first.</b>  And we do this by specifying the best products to meet their needs and providing multiple choices irrespective of the manufacturer. <br><br>Pearl Street only specifies and supplies select top-tier lighting and controls equipment manufacturers, and Pearl Street’s high volume purchasing affords us very competitive pricing which we can pass onto our customers.</p>

      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px">
        <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong> delivers value through a comprehensive “end to end” approach, beginning with initial program/project screenings, master plan studies, investment grade lighting audits, detailed project designs, project delivery, performance validation and project financing. Our approach consistently delivers new LED lighting systems upgrades that yield the greatest energy savings, highest dependability and longest life.
      </p>
      <p>
        An optimal LED lighting solution requires in-depth knowledge and application expertise specific to LED technologies. With upgrades and renovations there are many paths, equipment options and specific approaches; do you simply <b>relamp</b> (or <b>relamp reballast</b>), <b>retrofit</b> or <b>replace</b> fixtures? In which application(s) do lighting controls make sense, and which solutions yield the optimal mix of desired light levels and economic benefits? Each solution path has its set of advantages and disadvantages for a facility and application, and Pearl Street Systems evaluates each of these solution paths. We work closely with our customers to understand their individual and unique needs and requirements, and we involve and inform them throughout the project development process. Customers are given options and will have all the information necessary to select the best path.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know there are a lot of choices in selecting a partner for an LED lighting project. These include lighting design firms, architects, electrical distributers, lighting equipment manufacturers and their sales agents/representatives, ESCO’s (Energy Service Companies), electrical contractors and others. It probably seems like everyone wants to sell you an LED fixture nowadays. But the truth is that LED lighting projects are not as simple as they may seem on the surface. There are a lot of questionable equipment vendors and products in the marketplace from a quality, performance and long-term reliability perspective and false claims – “shady” companies abound. <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong> helps customers navigate through this “LED Jungle” and is a transparent, unbiased and trusted partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong>, all our services are performed “in-house” with a highly qualified and experienced staff of LC certified lighting designers, engineers and field-tested project managers.
