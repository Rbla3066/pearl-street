      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re reading through this website, you have demonstrated an interest in LED lighting technology and upgrades.  But LED lighting almost sounds too good to be true because LEDs seem to "do it all" by reducing energy costs, virtually eliminating lighting maintenance and improving the quality of lighting.  So where is the catch and what are the potential risks with an LED lighting upgrade?  Well the catch is that it first has to be cost effective and provide an acceptable financial return first.  And the risks are that the upgrade does not provide the forecasted savings, is not as reliable and maintenance free as promised, or just doesn’t look as good as you had hoped.  With an LED upgrade you are making a 15+ year commitment to the design – if you are successful great, if not you are going to live with the poor results and the constant complaints from the building occupants for a very long time.  Even with a really bad upgrade result, it will be difficult to economically justify a future lighting upgrade (because there just isn’t much more energy left to save).
      </p>
      <p>
        So what can you do to ensure a successful project and mitigate risks?  The answer is pretty simple - don’t take shortcuts and fall victim to simplistic and vendor biased solution approaches commonly offered in the marketplace.  Partner with a SPECIALIZED, EXPERIENCED, INDEPENDENT and PROFESSIONAL LED lighting systems integrator and professional services provider.  And that firm is <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong> delivers value through a comprehensive “end to end” approach, beginning with initial program/project screenings, master plan studies, investment grade lighting audits, detailed project designs, project delivery, performance validation and project financing. Our approach consistently delivers LED lighting upgrades that yield the greatest energy savings, highest dependability and longest life.
      </p>
      <p>
        An optimal LED upgrade solution requires in-depth knowledge and application expertise specific to LED technologies. There are many paths, equipment options and specific approaches; do you simply upgrade with LED lamps, retrofit the fixtures, or replace with new fixtures?  In which applications do lighting controls make sense, and which solutions yield the optimal mix of desired light levels and economic benefits?  Each solution path has its set of advantages and disadvantages for a facility and application, and <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong> evaluates each of these solution paths.  We work closely with our customers to understand their individual and unique needs and requirements, and we involve and inform them throughout the project development process.  Customers are given choices and will have all the information necessary to select the best alternative, present options to the ultimate decision makers and receive funding approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know there are a lot of choices in selecting a vendor for an LED lighting upgrade.  These include electrical distributers, lighting equipment manufacturers, local manufacturer sales agents/representatives, ESCO’s (Energy Service Companies), electrical contractors and others.  It probably seems like everyone wants to sell you an LED solution nowadays.  But the truth is that LED lighting upgrades are not as simple as they may seem on the surface.  There are a lot of questionable equipment vendors and products in the marketplace from a quality, performance and long-term reliability perspective; false claims and shady companies abound. <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong> helps customers navigate through this “LED Jungle” and is an unbiased and trusted partner throughout the lighting upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <strong>Pearl Street Systems</strong>, all our services are performed “in-house” with a highly qualified and experienced staff of LC certified lighting designers, engineers and field-tested project managers.
